# What is ESCG? 
ESCG is an attempt for breaking the "unsolved" question towards explainable AI in stem education. The main focus of this project is to explore of the effectiveness agentic system for producing high-quality stem
video using multimodal evaluation loop. The proposed system architecture of this project is to incorporate knowledge graph and visual feedback using JEPA principles.
